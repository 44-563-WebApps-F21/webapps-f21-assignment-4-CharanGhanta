<h3>ACT IV- _Sitting-room in Mrs. Arbuthnot’s House at Wrockley_.</h3>

<p style="white-space: pre">
_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_.  _Large open French window at back_,
_looking on to garden_.  _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C.

<p class="stageDirections hover">[GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.]</p>

<p class="stageDirections hover">[_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.]</p>

<h5 class="name alice">ALICE.</h5>  <p>Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.</p>

<p class="stageDirections hover">[_Exit_ L.C.]</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>Good morning, Gerald.</p>

<h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p class="stageDirections hover">[_Rising_.]</p>  <p>Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs.
    Allonby.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p class="stageDirections hover">[_Sitting down_.]</p>  <p>We came to inquire for your dear
mother, Gerald.  I hope she is better?</p>

<h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p>My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last
night.  I think there must have been thunder in the air.  Or perhaps it
was the music.  Music makes one feel so romantic—at least it always gets
on one’s nerves.</p>

<h5 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p>It’s the same thing, nowadays.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>I am so glad I don’t know what you mean, dear.  I am
afraid you mean something wrong.  Ah, I see you’re examining Mrs.
Arbuthnot’s pretty room.  Isn’t it nice and old-fashioned?</p>

<h5 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p class="stageDirections hover">[_Surveying the room through her lorgnette_.]</p>  <p>It looks
quite the happy English home.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>That’s just the word, dear; that just describes it.
One feels your mother’s good influence in everything she has about her,
Gerald.</p>

<h5 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p>Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, but that
a good influence is the worst in the world.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot better he
will change his mind.  I must certainly bring him here.</p>

<h5 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p>I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy English
home.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>It would do him a great deal of good, dear.  Most women
in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothing but
orchids, foreigners, and French novels.  But here we have the room of a
sweet saint.  Fresh natural flowers, books that don’t shock one, pictures
that one can look at without blushing.</p>

<h5 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5> <p>But I like blushing.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,
if one can do it at the proper moment.  Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
me I didn’t blush nearly often enough.  But then he was so very
particular.  He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those
who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,
was brought into the Divorce Court.  A most unfortunate case.</p>

<h5 class="name allonby">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  <p>I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the
devotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?
By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
often now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?</p>

<h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p>I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s
secretary.</p>

<h5 class="name ladyHunstanton">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  <p>Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.
What reason can you have?</p>

<h5 class="name gerald">GERALD.</h5>  <p>I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.</p>
